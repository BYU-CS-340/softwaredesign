# C S 340 Syllabus - Software Design

## Course Description

This class is about software design. Software design is about how to effectively structure and organize code so that it is:

- Functional
- Understandable
- Easy to evolve
- Testable
- Reusable

By the end of the course you should have met the following outcomes:

1. Learn principles of effective software design
2. Understand design patterns and their application
3. Learn to effectively document and communicate software designs
4. Gain experience with cloud computing
5. Apply 1-4 on a significant software project

CS 340 follows what is sometimes called a flipped class room model where students are expected to do reading in preparation for each class. The classes themselves are organized around quizzes and hands-on exercises. Read about how our flipped classroom works [HERE](flipped-classroom.md).

That way everyone benefits from your work, and you are listed as a contributor on a significant open source project.

##  Prerequisites

Complete CS 260 and CS 240 with a passing grade (C- or better)

This class is scheduled to meet for an hour and fifty minutes two times per week. By staying in the class, you assert that you are able and willing to meet during this time each class day.

If you do not satisfy these prerequisites, please drop the course.

## Late Policy

10% penalty per school day late. Late penalties are capped at 50%, meaning that you will never receive more than a 50% late penalty, even if you submit something more than 5 days late.

Late penalties may be waived if extenuating circumstances exist. If you feel that this is your situation, please talk to your instructor. However, please note that "I had to do assignments for my other classes" and "I had to work extra hours at my job" are not considered extenuating circumstances. Extenuating circumstances are unusual things you could not have planned for.

Assignments may not be submitted for credit after the last day of class.

This late policy does not apply to quizzes. Quizzes may not be taken late because we make the answers available immediately after the due date. However, we drop your lowest quiz score, so a missed quiz will just become the quiz we drop.

## Resubmission Policy

For in-class exercises and other assignments that do not require a passoff, if you lose points due to an incorrect submission, the TAs will leave feedback suggesting how to improve your score. If the assignment is redone and resubmitted within one week of the assignment being graded, you can get back up to half of the points that you lost. However, if your initial submission was late, the original late penalty will still apply.

Ex: if you lose 20% for being two days late, and another 10% for missing a function, you will receive 70% credit. If you add the missing function and resubmit, you can get back half of the 10% lost, for 75%.

## LLMs, Generative AI, etc. Policy

1. Students may use AI assistants to support their learning and course objectives. Not all AI generated information (or code, for that matter) is accurate or consistent with what we are teaching in this course. Please do not let uncritical use of AI tools interfere with your learning.
2. *Students may not submit code that was written by an AI tool* (such as ChatGPT or Copilot). Students should treat AI assistants like they might fellow students or TAs: getting clarifications and explanations is appropriate, but it is crucial for students to do their own work and only submit work that is their own.
3. With each milestone, students are to submit a statement disclosing any AI tools used in completing the milestone. Naturally, it is important that the AI tool use (disclosed or not) be consistent with #1 and #2 above.

##   Grade Scheme

The following grading standards will be used in this class:

| Grade | Range             |
| :---- | :---------------- |
| A     | 100 % to 93.0%    |
| A-    | < 93.0 % to 90.0% |
| B+    | < 90.0 % to 87.0% |
| B     | < 87.0 % to 83.0% |
| B-    | < 83.0 % to 80.0% |
| C+    | < 80.0 % to 77.0% |
| C     | < 77.0 % to 73.0% |
| C-    | < 73.0 % to 70.0% |
| D+    | < 70.0 % to 67.0% |
| D     | < 67.0 % to 63.0% |
| D-    | < 63.0 % to 60.0% |
| F     | < 60.0 % to 0.0%  |

## Grade Appeals

The TA's and the instructor are imperfect and may make a mistake when grading assignments and exams. We want you to receive the grade you deserve, but some of this responsibility lies with you. You are welcome to appeal any grades you receive, but grade appeals for any assignments or exams must be requested within seven calendar days of the time the score for the item being appealed is posted. You may not receive an email or an in-class announcement about when scores are posted, so you should check regularly.

We have found that some students are satisfied with their grades until they find at the end of the semester that a few more points would make a difference in the grade they receive. Then a "fishing for points" expedition begins. We are unable to accommodate this, so if you are unsatisfied with a grade, appeal it early.

If appealing a grade, start by discussing the item(s) in question with a TA during office hours (preferably the TA who did the original grading). Be prepared to give a detailed explanation of why you think the grade is incorrect. If you are not able to come to a satisfactory conclusion with the TA, contact the instructor. Keep in mind that although rare, re-grades can, and sometimes do, result in a lower score.

## Honor Code Standards

In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university.

Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and my own expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.

## Harassment

Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically, BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the university but to students as well. If you encounter sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other inappropriate behavior, please talk to your professor, contact the Equal Employment Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at 422-2847.

## Disabilities

BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services deemed appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by that office.

## Children in the Classroom

The serious study of the physical and mathematical sciences requires uninterrupted concentration and focus in the classroom. Having small children in class is often a distraction that degrades the educational experience for the entire class. Please make other arrangements for child care rather than bringing children to class with you. If there are extenuating circumstances, please talk with your instructor in advance.
