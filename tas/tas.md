**Note: There is a 3 visit limit for TA help per day.** This is to encourage you to do as much as you can on your own before coming for help.

## For help during class hours

During class hours, one TA will sometimes be available in the lab, but this is not guranteed. In-class TAs' attention is primarily on the students in class. Pass offs are not guaranteed by in class TA's. If you need help during another section's class time and no one is in the lab, use the #exercies & #milestone channels on our Slack. (The link to join Slack is on [this page](https://github.com/BYU-CS-340/softwaredesign/blob/main/README.md).)

## For help in person

Stop by the TA Lab in TMCB 1160. If it's very busy (such as on a pass off day), you may want to message a TA on Slack first, then come to the lab if they indicate that they are available.

## For help on Slack

We have a #help-queue channel (You might need to search and add it) if you want help from TAs. You can also ask questions in the #exercises and #milestone channels on our Slack. (The link to join Slack is on [this page](https://github.com/BYU-CS-340/softwaredesign/blob/main/README.md).)

## For help on Zoom

###

> [!WARNING]
> On pass off weeks, especially towards the deadline, if a TA isn't in their personal zoom room they may be busy with passing students off and won't be available to help with individual questions.

If the TA is not in their Zoom room during their hours, message them on Slack.

If a TA is not in the Lab, they may be available over Zoom; message them on Slack.
